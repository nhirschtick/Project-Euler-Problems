# Project-Euler-Problems
Solutions to problems from https://projecteuler.net

Project Euler is a website that lists hundreds of problems that all have one integer answers. It was shown to me by my highschool computer science teacher as a great example of approachable problems that are made infinitely easier if you can code them.

I really like this website because it is difficult to explain to someone who just started coding why the thing they just used to print "hello world" is an incredibly powerful tool. Project Euler helps to explain that. It's one thing to write a for-loop that prints "cat dog" 100 times and a completely different thing to find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. (The answer is 233168 and this is the first problem listed on Project Euler's website)

In recent years, I've used many of the problems on this website as a way of brushing up on or learning new coding languages and as a way of keeping myself in the cs mindset at times when I'm not taking any computer science classes in school. It really helps me develop creative problem solving.
